the battery level was checked every 3 seconds.
The adjustment decisions were made based on the work to be done and the energy left to be consume.
If the left work is greater than the energy left, decrease the amount of work dynamically.
If the energy left is greater than (left work * 1.1), increase the amount of work dynamically.

The experiment setting is 
				1)baseline
				2)allocate 80% of baseline energy 
				3) allocate 60% of baseline energy
